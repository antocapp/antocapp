###Â BERT for Italian Question Answering

This transformer model is the uncased base version of the italian BERT trained on the question answering task for the italian language. It has been trained using [SQuAD-it](http://sag.art.uniroma2.it/demo-software/squadit/), derived from the original SQuAD dataset and obtained through the semi-automatic translation of the SQuAD dataset from English to Italian.

For more, check the page on the [HuggingFace's ModelHub](https://huggingface.co/antoniocappiello/bert-base-italian-uncased-squad-it) to play with it or see how to try it through the transformers library.
